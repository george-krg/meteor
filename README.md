# Title: 
Meteor Fight
# Estimated Time:
6 h
# Difficulty Level:
Intermediate
# Prerequisites:
2.16 Python Basics - Basic Tools and Libraries
# Topics:
Using classes and functions to implement a simple game by the use of the pygame library. The necessary files for the use of the library will be provided in a skeleton application and the student will develop further the game logic 
# Scenario:
A skeleton game is provided in order the students to understand the existing code, the use of the library and extent the development of the game. The game is about defending earth against falling meteors. For this you have command of a spacecraft that has the task to fire missiles and destroy the falling meteors. The spacecraft moves with the arrows left or right at the bottom of the game screen and fires missiles by pressing Space. The project will be further developped by adding functionalities and features to the game as following:
## Version 1
1. You will group the settings of the game that influence difficulty and change them according to a level value. The game starts from the lowest level (easier).
2. The difficulty settings will include the number of meteors falling at once, the speed at which they fall, and the frequency of the enemy spacecraft's attacks.
3. The difficulty level will start at 1 and increase as the player progresses through the game.
4. You will count the number of meteors that are not destroyed and if this number exceeds a limit the user loses.
5. The player will have a limited number of lives that will decrease each time a meteor hits the Earth.
6. When the player's lives are depleted, the game is over.
7. When the player exceeds certain score values go up one level in difficulty
8. The player will earn points for each meteor destroyed. As the player reaches certain score milestones, they will progress to the next level of difficulty. 
## Version 2
1. Create an enemy spacecraft that will move at the top of the screen and fire against your ship. 
2. The missiles of this enemy spacecraft will not destroy meteors but target only at your spacecraft.
3. The enemy spacecraft will move across the top of the screen and periodically fire missiles at the player's spacecraft.
4. If the player's spacecraft is hit by an enemy missile, they will lose a life.
